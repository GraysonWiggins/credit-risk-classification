# Overview of the Analysis
In this section, I will describe the analysis completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge:


##Purpose of the Analysis:
The purpose of this analysis was to develop machine learning models to predict credit risk for loan applications.

##Financial Information:
 The data used in this analysis included various financial features such as credit scores, income levels, loan amounts, and other relevant financial metrics. The goal was to predict whether a loan application represents a healthy loan (0) or a high-risk loan (1).

##Variables to Predict:
 The target variable for prediction was the loan_status column, where 0 represents healthy loans and 1 represents high-risk loans.

##Stages of the Machine Learning Process:
 The analysis involved stages such as data preprocessing, splitting the data into training and testing sets, model selection, model training, and evaluation of model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

##Methods Used: 
The main algorithm used in this analysis was Logistic Regression, a popular classification algorithm for binary outcomes.

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
Accuracy Score: 0.99

Precision: Class 0: 1.00, Class 1: 0.85

Recall: Class 0: 0.99, Class 1: 0.91

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
The Logistic Regression model performed exceptionally well with high accuracy, precision, and recall scores.
The model excelled in predicting healthy loans (0) with near-perfect precision and recall.
It also demonstrated good performance in predicting high-risk loans (1) with respectable precision and recall scores.
Based on the results, the Logistic Regression model seems to be the best choice for predicting credit risk in this scenario.
The performance of the model is crucial for both predicting healthy and high-risk loans, ensuring accurate classification for both classes.

Therefore, I recommend utilizing the Logistic Regression model for credit risk prediction due to its high performance across both classes.
